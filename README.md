# ai-agent-reporter
An AI agent that does more than just call a single LLM. It should: ● Take a user query ● Find 2–3 useful sources online. ● Summarize what you found using an LLM. ● Create a short, structured report with key points and links. ● Save the report in a database so it can be looked up later. ● Show the saved reports in a basic web view.
